This is a growing collection of my small, lightweight JavaScript experiments, and mini-projects. This repo is my personal playground, a place where I test ideas, practice new concepts, and keep track of all the little “snacks” I build while learning and improving as a developer.

Each folder contains its own mini-project with a simple setup. Nothing too serious, just code, curiosity, and continuous practice.

### Note

This repo isn’t meant for teaching or “best practice” examples. The code here reflects whatever approach I tried at that moment. It’s not the only way or the best way to solve these problems. I come back every now and then to refactor stuff with whatever new tricks I’ve picked up.
